## EDA

```{r}
var_lib <- read.csv('BMI714_NHANES_VariableDictionary.csv')
nhanes_2020 <- read.csv("BMI714_NHANES2020_Data.csv")

# okay, 1500+ variables
#head(nhanes_2020)

# the meta groups that exist within variables, I'm interested in laboratory
table(var_lib$Component)
```


### How do each lab variable correlate with each other?

```{r}
## first subset main dataframe to just lab variables
lab_var <- var_lib%>%
  filter(Component == "Laboratory")%>%
  pull(BMI_714_Variable_Name)

nhanes_lab <- nhanes_2020%>%
  select(lab_var)

#head(nhanes_lab)
```

Seems like there's a lot of NAs, let's see how bad it is

```{r}
# there exists no patient that did all 438 lab tests, so let's find a subset of lab vars for which we have a good size of patients 
#drop_na(nhanes_lab)

# first let's see how many NA's each variable has
n_patients <- nrow(nhanes_lab)

na_prop_list <- c()
for (i in 1:ncol(nhanes_lab)) {
  curr_prop <- sum(is.na(nhanes_lab[,i]))/n_patients
  na_prop_list[i] <- curr_prop
}
names(na_prop_list) <- colnames(nhanes_lab)

hist(na_prop_list)
# so a majority of the lab vars contain ~0.8 NA's

# let's set 0.5 as an NA threshold for subsetting lab variables, 
# with the hope that the leftover lab vars will yield a non-zero patient cohort
low_na_vars <- names(na_prop_list[na_prop_list<0.5])
length(low_na_vars)
nrow(nhanes_lab%>%select(low_na_vars)%>%drop_na())
```

We saw that each of the lab variables have differing rate of NAs. 

  *sanity check*: if a variable A has 0.5 NA rate, then that means half of the total 15560 patients will have an NA for that variable. Our goal is to find a subset of patients and a set of variables for which there exists no NAs. If we introduce some variable B also with 0.5 NA rate and we find the patients that have no NA for either variable, we should expect a result size of less than half of 15560 because it's not necessarily true that everyone who tested for var A also tested for var B (we can sure hope).
  
Thus, we have that 1) the lower the NA rate threshold, the less resulting variable subset, 2) the less resuling variable subset, the more patients will be leftover at the end. (consider the base case where only the lab var with NA rate of 0.00001 is left, which means almost all 15560 patients will be selected)

If we look at only the variables with at most 0.5 NA rate, we end up with ~5000 patients. Let's see if we can do better, our goal is to maximize the size of subsetted variables while having the most patients we can work with. 

```{r}
# set threshold value from 0.01 to 0.50, expect more consensus patient as threshold decrease
consensus_patient_n <- c()
filtered_var_n <- c()
i <- 1
for (t in seq(0.01, 0.5, by = 0.01)) {
  low_na_vars <- names(na_prop_list[na_prop_list<t])
  filtered_var_n[i] <- length(low_na_vars)
  consensus_patient_n[i] <- nrow(nhanes_lab%>%select(low_na_vars)%>%drop_na())
  i <- i + 1
}
names(consensus_patient_n) <- seq(0.01, 0.5, by = 0.01)
names(filtered_var_n) <- seq(0.01, 0.5, by = 0.01)

# aggregate results in dataframe for plotting
results_df <- data.frame(
  Threshold = seq(0.01, 0.5, by = 0.01),
  Consensus_Patients = consensus_patient_n,
  Filtered_Variables = filtered_var_n
)


# the lower the threshold the more patients
ggplot(results_df, aes(x = Threshold, y = Consensus_Patients)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_reverse() + 
  labs(
    title = "Consensus Patients vs NA Threshold",
    x = "NA Threshold (Reversed)",
    y = "Number of Consensus Patients"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# the lower the threshold the less variables
ggplot(results_df, aes(x = Threshold, y = Filtered_Variables)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_reverse() + 
  labs(
    title = "Filtered Variables vs NA Threshold",
    x = "NA Threshold (Reversed)",
    y = "Number of Filtered Variables"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# post hoc
label_point <- results_df[results_df$Threshold == 0.31, ]

# the more variable the less consensus patients 
ggplot(results_df, aes(x = Filtered_Variables, y = Consensus_Patients)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel(
    data = label_point,
    aes(label = paste("NA rate =", Threshold, "\n Filtered Variables # =", Filtered_Variables, "\n Patient # =", Consensus_Patients)),
    nudge_x = 30,  # Nudges the label to the right
    nudge_y = 1000, # Nudges the label upwards
    segment.color = "blue", # Line color
    segment.size = 0.5,     # Line thickness
    color = "blue",         # Label text color
    box.padding = 0.5,      # Space around the text
    point.padding = 0.5     # Space around the point
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Consensus Patients vs Number of Filtered Variables",
    x = "Number of Filtered Variables",
    y = "Number of Consensus Patients"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

By elbow rule, we pick NA rate to be 0.31, and continue with the leftover data subset.

```{r}
selected_vars <- names(na_prop_list[na_prop_list<0.31])
nhane_sub <- nhanes_lab%>%select(selected_vars)%>%drop_na()
summary(nhane_sub)

# what are these lab values actually corresponding to?
table(var_lib%>%filter(BMI_714_Variable_Name %in% colnames(nhane_sub))%>%pull(Data_File_Description))


# large scale correlation check by heatmap
## but first drop two columns that have 0 standard deviation -- the values were probably all 0 anyways
pdf(paste0(plot.out.dir, "/correlation_subsetted_labvar.pdf"), width = 25, height = 25)
nhane_sub <- nhane_sub[, apply(nhane_sub, 2, sd) != 0]
cor_matrix <- cor(nhane_sub, use = "complete.obs", method = "pearson")
sub_anno <- var_lib%>%
  filter(BMI_714_Variable_Name %in% colnames(nhane_sub))%>%
  select(BMI_714_Variable_Name, Data_File_Description)
cor_matrix_ordered <- cor_matrix[,sub_anno$BMI_714_Variable_Name]
p <- pheatmap(cor_matrix_ordered, 
         color = colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(n = 11, name = "Spectral"))(50),
         display_numbers = F, cluster_rows = F, cluster_cols = F)
print(p)
dev.off
